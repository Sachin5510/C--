 //  OOPs- Classes & object 
    // class-> extension of structures (in C)
    // structures had limitations.
            // --  members are public
            // --  No methods
    // 1. structures did not support methods
    // 2. structures did not support inheritance
    // classes = structures + more
    // classes can have methods and properties
    // clasess can  make few members as private & few as Public
    // classes can support inheritance
    // classes are more powerful than structures

    // structures in C++ are typedef
    // you can declare objects along with the class declaration.
    // the function inside the class are defined inside the class itself
