// In this tutorial, we will discuss constructors in C++

// Constructors in C++

// A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class. The constructor doesnâ€™t have a return type. Constructors are used to initialize the objects of its class. Constructors are automatically invoked whenever an object is created.

// Important Characteristics of Constructors in C++

// A constructor should be declared in the public section of the class
// They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created
// They cannot return values and do not have return types
// It can have default arguments
// We cannot refer to their address
