// Inheritance & Its Different Types with Examples in C++
// Program to demonstrate the concept of Inheritance in C++ Programming
// **** reusability of code ****
// reusing classes saves time and effort ,money and resources
// The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance
// We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inherititing from it
// The existing class is called as the Base Class
// The new class which is inherited is called as the Derived Class
// Reusing classes saves time and money
// There are different types of inheritance in C++
// 1. Single Inheritance
// EX. class B: public ----A EK bap ek beta

// 2. Multiple Inheritance
// EX. class C: public A, public B -----maa-baap ek beta

// 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
// EX. class B: public A, class C: public A  ----ek bap do bete
// 4. Multilevel Inheritance
